## Libraries

- Using Processing (https://processing.org/reference) as the library to help with UI.
- Chose this because it seems more lightweight than other options like libGDX.
- Not using the Processing IDE though. If you want to download the jar on your own (for mac), go to [Processing download](https://processing.org/download), download it, right click the download, select Show Package Contents, and find the "core.jar" file in the "Java" folder.
